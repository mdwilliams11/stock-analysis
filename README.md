# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
This project involved helping Steve to analyze multiple different green energy stocks using multiple VBA macros. Starting with the stock data from 2017 and 2018 we wanted to create a macro that would loop through all of the data and return the total daily volume and the annual return on each of the green energy stocks.

Analysis was conducted within this [Macro-Enabled Excel Workbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdwilliams11/stock-analysis/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm)
